to elucidate about cyber security and take a step
towards making a cyber secure world. Online
activities are vulnerable to crime and can
compromise personal safety as effectively as
everyday crimes. The only difference between a
normal crime and a cybercrime lies in the tool used
to commit the crime. Cybercrime can be categorized
into two categories - (a) The Computer as a Target
to attack other computers which are inclusive of
crimes like phishing and ransomware (b) The
Computer as a weapon to commit real-world crimes
which include crimes like cyber-harassment and
financial fraud. Our cyber shatrus a.k.a hackers have
different motives like Greed, Power, Publicity,
Revenge, Adventure, Desire to access forbidden
information, Destructive mindset, etc. Cyber shatrus
can destroy important data and also cause
defamation leading to a negative impact on society
either directly or indirectly. Let's fight the cyber
shatrus with rationality and become cyber yodhas!
